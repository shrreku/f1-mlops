## Project: End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Real-Time Fraud Detection

### 1. Overview

Build a production-grade machine learning system that ingests transaction streams, detects fraudulent activity in real time, and continuously retrains and deploys updated models. Code will be developed locally in VS Code and executed on Google Colab or Kaggle notebooks.

### 2. Objectives

- Detect fraudulent transactions with ≥ 90% precision and recall
- Automate data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring
- Ensure reproducibility via version control and CI/CD
- Provide a REST API for real-time scoring


### 3. Scope \& Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Batch ingest historical data; simulate streaming via mini-batches
- **Feature Store**: Compute and store features (e.g., transaction amount, time deltas)
- **Model Training**: Train isolation forest and LSTM ensembles
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing, training, containerization, and deployment
- **Deployment**: Containerized FastAPI service on Colab/Kaggle environment
- **Monitoring**: Dashboard for model drift, latency, throughput, and accuracy
- **Alerts**: Slack/email notifications for drift or performance degradation


### 4. User Stories

- As a data engineer, I want to pull new transaction files from Google Drive into Colab daily.
- As an ML engineer, I want to trigger retraining when model performance drops below 90%.
- As an operations lead, I want a dashboard showing request latency and error rates.
- As a fraud analyst, I want real-time flagged transactions via API calls.


### 5. Functional Requirements

- FR1: Ingest CSV transaction files via scheduled Colab job
- FR2: Preprocess data (clean missing values, encode categorical features)
- FR3: Train and evaluate ensemble model; log metrics to MLflow
- FR4: Dockerize model and API; push images to GitHub Container Registry
- FR5: Deploy API endpoint in Colab/Kaggle; handle 100 req/s
- FR6: Track model versions and roll back if needed


### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR1: 95th-percentile latency ≤ 200 ms per API call
- NFR2: System availability ≥ 99%
- NFR3: Training pipeline completes within 2 hours
- NFR4: All code and artifacts versioned in Git
- NFR5: Documentation completeness ≥ 90%


### 7. Data Requirements

- **Historical Dataset**: Kaggle credit card fraud dataset (284,807 transactions; 0.17% fraud)
- **Features**:
    - Numerical: Transaction amount, time between transactions
    - Categorical: Merchant category, transaction type
    - Derived: Rolling averages, Z-score of amount
- **Storage**: CSVs on Google Drive; feature store as Pandas HDF5


### 8. System Architecture

1. **Source Control**: GitHub repo hosting code, Dockerfile, CI workflows
2. **Notebook Development**: VS Code PyLance extension + Remote-SSH to Colab/Kaggle
3. **Data Pipeline**: Colab notebook scheduled via GitHub Actions
4. **Model Registry**: MLflow tracking server (hosted in Colab)
5. **Containerization**: Docker build via GitHub Actions
6. **Deployment**:
    - Quick tests on Kaggle’s Docker support or Colab’s local REST endpoint
    - Expose FastAPI on ngrok for external testing
7. **Monitoring**:
    - Prometheus client in API
    - Grafana dashboard embedded in Colab

### 9. Technical Stack

- Python 3.10, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (IsolationForest), TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)
- FastAPI for serving
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- ngrok for local tunneling
- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring


### 10. MLOps Pipeline

1. **CI**: On push to `main`, run unit tests, lint, security scans
2. **CD (Training)**:
    - Triggered weekly or on performance drop
    - Executes Colab notebook via `colab-cli` to retrain model
    - Logs new model artifacts to MLflow
3. **CD (Deployment)**:
    - Build Docker image with new model
    - Push to GitHub Container Registry
    - Redeploy FastAPI on Colab/Kaggle via `docker run`
4. **Monitoring \& Alerts**:
    - Collect metrics with Prometheus client
    - Grafana dashboards updated in real time
    - Alert if endpoint error rate > 1% or drift detected

### 11. Development Setup

- **VS Code Workspace**:
    - `src/` for modules, `notebooks/` for Colab notebooks
    - `.devcontainer/` for consistent environment (Python, Docker CLI)
- **Remote Execution**:
    - Use Colab’s REST API or Kaggle’s notebook runner to execute notebooks
    - Configure `colab-cli` or Kaggle API in GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**:
    - Branching model: `feature/*`, `develop`, `main`
    - Pull requests with mandatory reviews and CI green light


### 12. Timeline \& Milestones

| Week | Milestone |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Data ingestion, preprocessing modules, baseline model |
| 2 | Advanced model (LSTM), experiment tracking with MLflow |
| 3 | API development with FastAPI, Dockerfile creation |
| 4 | CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions, deployment tests |
| 5 | Monitoring setup (Prometheus/Grafana), alert rules |
| 6 | Final integration, documentation, performance tuning |

### 13. Success Metrics

- Model precision and recall ≥ 90% on hold-out set
- CI pipeline passing on every commit
- API latency ≤ 200 ms at 100 req/s
- Automated retraining without manual intervention
- Deployed system uptime ≥ 99% over two weeks of testing

This PRD equips you with a clear roadmap to build, deploy, and monitor a real-time fraud detection system using VS Code for development and Colab/Kaggle for execution.
